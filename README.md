## Development of Appsody as a standalone project has ended, but the core technologies of Appsody have been merged with odo to create odo 2.0! See our [blog post](https://appsody.dev/blogs/DevelopmentEnded) for more details!

# Homebrew Core

Core formulae for the Homebrew package manager.

Core formulae for the Linuxbrew package manager (Homebrew on Linux or Windows 10 Subsystem for Linux) are in [Homebrew/linuxbrew-core](https://github.com/Homebrew/linuxbrew-core).

## How do I install these formulae?

Just `brew install <formula>`. This is the default tap for Homebrew and is installed by default.
